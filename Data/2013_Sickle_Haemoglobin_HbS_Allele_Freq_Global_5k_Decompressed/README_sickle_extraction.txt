Note on Large Raster Data Files

The raster datasets used to extract sickle cell frequency distributions are too large to be hosted on GitHub, but they are publicly available from the official sources listed below.
To reproduce the sickle cell extraction step, please download these files manually and place them in the appropriate Data/ subdirectory before running sickle_extraction.R.

If you encounter any issues accessing the files, the author can provide them upon reasonable request.
